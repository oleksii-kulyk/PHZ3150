Are there these files (indicate missing with M, wrong name with W):
Y  0-phz3150-oleksiy.log
Y  project_oleksiy.py
M  project_oleksiy.out -- you should have a file with the output of your code, -1
Y  a .py file containing supplementary functions
Y  project_oleksiy_prob3_graph1.png
Y  project_oleksiy_prob4_graph1.png
Y  project_oleksiy_prob7_graph1.png
Y  project_oleksiy_prob8_graph1.png
Y  project_oleksiy_prob8_graph2.png

N  Are there extra files (~ files or other)?


Note that all files handed in, including the directory, should have your username (e.g., project_oleksiy). Since you and others didn't do this, I had 1 directory with a bunch of different peoples' files. -1


1. 5/5
