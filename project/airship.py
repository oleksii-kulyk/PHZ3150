"""NAME
    airship

DESCRIPTION
    A module for controling your airships' various cannons.

CLASSES
    Cannon

NOTES
    See the Cannon docstring
"""


import numpy as np


class Cannon():
    """Attributes
----------
phi : float
    The azimuthal angle the cannon's barrel.
theta : float
    The zenith angle the cannon's barrel.
vel : float
    The velocity of an object as it leaves the barrel of the cannon.
adjt : float
    The time it takes for the cannon to adjust.

Notes
-----
Manually 

This class can be used to take control of one of the airships'
cannons. Do NOT use this unless you are authorised, or the fate of
humanity depends on it. (Cannons are very dangerous)

Examples
--------
>>> import airship
>>> cannon = airship.Cannon(1234)
>>> # "cannon" controls cannon number 1234
"""

    def __init__(self, serialnum):
        """Parameters
----------
serialnum : int
    serial number of the cannon you would like to take control of

"""

        self.theta = np.pi/4
        self.vel   = 20
        self.adjt  = .05

    def adjust(self, phipower, velpower):
        """Adjusts the cannon.

This method adjusts azimuthal angle of the cannon, as well as a
mechanism which determines the velocity of things launched from the
cannon. The cannon's vel and phi attributes will be updated after
phipower and velpower are sent to their respective systems.

Parameters
----------
phipower : float

    A float giving the amount of power to send to the motor
    controlling the azimuthal angle of the cannon's barrel.

velpower : float

    A float giving the amount of power to send to the motor
    controling the velocity of objects launched.

Returns
-------
None

Examples
--------
>>> import airship
>>> cannon = airship.Cannon(1234)

>>> print(cannon.phi)

>>> cannon.adjust(2, 25)
