Looked through the alias documentation online and through alias --help.
Created an alias for IN:
alias IN="echo -e '\n'*****IN: `date`'\n''\n' >> /media/oleksiy/MEGASync/Classes/Spring2019/PHZ3150/Oleksii-Kulyk.log" automatically creates a new entry of the form "*****IN <current unix date>" in this log. 
Created an alies for OUT:
alias OUT="echo -e '\n'*****OUT: `date`'\n' >> /media/oleksiy/MEGASync/Classes/Spring2019/PHZ3150/Oleksii-Kulyk.log" automatically creates a new entry of the form "*****OUT <current unix date>" in this log.

Ask about the pointers to pointers in the example program that was shown in this class.

*****OUT: Thu Jan 10 10:07:27 EST 2019

*****IN: Mon Jan 14 16:38:19 EST 2019

Realised that the alias command described above only creates a temporary alias.
Read some internet. Created permannent aliases in ~/.bash_aliases. That should do it.d

Started HW 2:

Problem 1:
(a)
Couldn't find Install Party Survey.
Remark of the professor: uname -a
Linux HP-OMEN 4.15.0-43-generic #46-Ubuntu SMP Thu Dec 6 14:45:28 UTC 2018 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
Since I have disk space, decided to install Anaconda.
Went to https://www.anaconda.com/download/#linux and downloaded the Python 3.7 version install script.
Ran the install script.
Accepted to initialize Anaconda# in /home/oleksiy/.bashrc
Accepted the installation of VSCode
Anaconda does not come with an executable program in Ubuntu. Nothing to run.
Attaching a screenshot of installation process from Terminal.
Made a screenshot by pressing PrtSc button.
Name the screenshot as hw2_oleksiy_prob1_anaconda.png

(b)
Went to https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/download.html#gnu-linux
Followed an advice from a website to install emacs from a distro repository.
In terminal: sudo apt search emacs
Returned to many entries
Went to https://www.admintome.com/blog/install-emacs-26-1-on-ubuntu/
Decided to stick with downloading the source code from the official site
Downloaded emacs-26.1.tar.gz from http://mirror.team-cymru.com/gnu/emacs/
Extracted files from an archive.
Following INSTALL file from extraced emacs folder.
Terminal:
cd ~/Downloads/emacs-26.1
./configure
configure: error: The following required libraries were not found:
    libXpm libjpeg libgif/libungif libtiff gnutls
Maybe some development libraries/packages are missing?
If you don't want to link with them give
    --with-xpm=no --with-jpeg=no --with-gif=no --with-tiff=no --with-gnutls=no
as options to configure
Installing the missing libraries with apt:
sudo apt install libXpm libjpeg libgif/libungif libtiff gnutls
E: Unable to locate package libXpm
E: Unable to locate package libjpeg
E: Unable to locate package libgif
E: Unable to locate package libtiff
E: Unable to locate package gnutls
The missing packges are availible via git. Need to install git first.
Skipping on to step (c)

(c)
Gaining access to Unix shell: Ctr+Shift+T. Done!
Took a screenshot of a Unix shell. Named it hw2_oleksiy_prob1_UnixShell.png

(d)
sudo apt install -y git
git status
fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
Took a screenshot of open Terminal. Named it hw2_oleksiy_prob1_UnixShell.png
Done!
Returning to step (b). Finishing Step (b).

(b)
Going back to (d) to set up git.

(d)
Went to https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-git-on-ubuntu-18-04 and read the tutorial
Decided to configure git later. Maybe emacs will configure without the missing libraries.
I will install the missing libraries later.
Going to step (b)

(b)
./cofigure
make
make: *** No targets specified and no makefile found.  Stop.
Reread the instructions from INSTALL more carefully.
Found a solution for my case. Following * Image support libraries section from INSTALL
Went to https://www.x.org/releases/current/src/lib/ and downloaded libXpm-3.5.10
Unarchived libXpm-3.5.10
cd /home/oleksiy/Downloads/libXpm-3.5.10
./configure
make
make check
sudo make install
Libraries have been installed in:
   /usr/local/lib
Installed libXpm!
Going to http://www.ijg.org/ and downloaded jpeg-9c
cd ~/Downloads/jpeg-9c
./configure
make
make check
sudo make install
Libraries have been installed in:
   /usr/local/lib
Installed jpeg-9c!
Ran out of patiance.
After some digging on the Internet found a snapshot repository. Read what a snapshot package is.
OK.
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-elisp/ppa
sudo apt update
sudo apt search emacs
sudo apt install emacs-snapshot
Y
Didn't actually understand what a snapshot package is, but I now have emacs!!!
This also means that I will have to uninstall everything I installed by hand in this session.
And on this happy note I end.

Started doing Problem 2 of HW 2.
Started reading ThinkPython
Installed Spyder
sudo apt install spyder3
Still reading ThinkPython
Ran emacs and took a screenshot, which I named hw2_oleksiy_prob1_emacs.png
Read the assigned chapter of ThinkPython

HW2:
Problem 2:

!f y0u c@n read th1s, it m3@ns that you c@n @dap1.
If you this that can adapt it means, you can read.

Natural languages are not used as programming languages because they are ambiguous, redundant, and idiomatic. Ambuguity makes it often impossible to convey precise scintific concepts and ideas. Redundancy is created as a way to get rid of ambiguity; sometimes redundancy is also added to expand context (artistic descriptions in creative writing). The common use of idioms creates ambuguity and reduces concision.

Questions in class:
When was GNU born?
Not ever file recovery tools can restore files after rm? How are the files deleted? the disk blocks are linked to a directory. rm removes those links. One file can occupy numerous scattered blocks.
alias problem with `date`
How does Linux manage extensions? a program called "file" most file have a identifier at the top.
How does Linux manage fragmentation? ext4
ls -l size in what units? Answer: Bytes
What is a shapshot package?

Memo:
ls -ltr
-t list by time from old to new
-r reverse the sequence

Cut and Paste: Highlight and Middle click
Emacs notation: M=Alt
cp -a is the same as cp -dR --preserve-all
-d from man cp = same as --no-dereference --preserve=links

alias o=xdg-open <file> looks for a program that reads the specifed file and opens the file with it.
$PATH a list of all directories that the Shell will search for executables. Essentially adding commands to the shell.

After moving my IN alias to .bash_aliases, it returns incorrect date. The date it returns is precisely the date that it was moved to .bash_aliases. Strange, I thought by using `date` in the backquotes I was making the system evaluate date as a unix variable. I will have to ask professor Harrington about this.

Started doing peer reviews. Decided to start with Amanda Cochran. She has a good work, although she didn't have the short explanation why natural languages are not used in the programming. According to rubric, had to take off 2 points for that. She got 58/60 from me. Also, she handed in the uncompressed file e.i. hw2.tar. Wrote a short note with two screenshots on how to use the tar command. Hope it helps.

Moving on to Vijay Stroup.
Everything is fine with Vijay. Had an wierd example of the first sentence, but, according to rubric, I am not allowed to take off points for wierd examples.

Moving on to Riley Havel.
Late submission 15 Jan 17:28. Don't know if the professor allowed her to submit late.
Fine work. Although, the log describes a lot of problems she encountered.

Looks like the work is done for today.

*****OUT Wed Jan 16 17:51:31 EST 2019

Forgot to sign myself out after the lesson. Only noiced it on Fri Jan 18. The following sign-out time will be approximate.

*****OUT Thu Jan 17 10:15:00 EST 2019

*****IN Fri Jan 18 10:58:53 EST 2019

Noticed that I had named my .log file incorrectly. Changing the name to "0-phz3150-oleksiy.log"
Also noticed that I had missed the peerevals for the HW1. Did them now.

*****OUT !around! Fri Jan 18 12:00:00 EST 2019

*****IN !around! Sun Jan 20 20:30:00 EST 2019

Forgot to sing out. The sign out time should have been around Fri Jan 18 12:00:00 EST 2019
Also, didn't sign in when I started doing what is decribed below, but it took me at least 2 hours to complete.
Uninstalled the jpeg-9c and libXpm-3.5.10 libraries that I installed during HW2 session when I was trying to install emacs.
Luckily, I simple make uninstall worked. Came across programs called checkinstall, auto-apt, and autodeb while looking for a way to uninstall jpeg-9c and libXpm-3.5.10.
These programs allow a user to create a .deb package out of a source code of a program in this way making the management of programs installed by hand much easier. Auto-apt also looks and downloads additional packages to satisfy dependencies for a program being installed from source code.
This means that a simple packet manager like apt or dpkg will be enough to control programs installed from source code.
All of these programs are relatively new and experimental. Still considering if I should get one, and If yes, then which of them.

Read the link https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7807605/unix-using-date-in-alias-doesnt-output-the-current-date-time sent by Michael Himes.
Read some manuals on creating aliases with multiple commands.
By trial and error arrived to ugly but WORKING forms of the IN and OUT aliases described below.
Changed my aliases for IN and OUT to:

alias IN="echo -en '\n'*****IN:\ >> /media/oleksiy/MEGASync/Classes/Spring2019/PHZ3150/0-phz3150-oleksiy.log && date >> /media/oleksiy/MEGASync/Classes/Spring2019/PHZ3150/0-phz3150-oleksiy.log && echo -en '\n' >> /media/oleksiy/MEGASync/Classes/Spring2019/PHZ3150/0-phz3150-oleksiy.log"

alias OUT="echo -en '\n'*****OUT:\ >> /media/oleksiy/MEGASync/Classes/Spring2019/PHZ3150/0-phz3150-oleksiy.log && date >> /media/oleksiy/MEGASync/Classes/Spring2019/PHZ3150/0-phz3150-oleksiy.log && echo -en '\n' >> /media/oleksiy/MEGASync/Classes/Spring2019/PHZ3150/0-phz3150-oleksiy.log"

<function print-lyrics at 0xb7e99e9c> is this the address of a function? How is a function stored?
What are function objects?
In C, a function must be declared in the beginning, but it can be defined later.

Forgot to sign out. I spent about 1 hour on reading the 3-rd chapter of ThinkPython during the previous section.
Continuing hw4. 

***** Now is Wed Jan 30 16:32:50 EST 2019.

Started doing problems:

Created an empty text document.
cd /home/oleksiy/Spring/home/oleksiy/Spring2019/PHZ3150/hw/handins
mkdir hw4_oleksiy
cd hw4_oleksiy
emacs -f hw4_oleksiy.py &
Did part 1.
Did part 2.
Did part 3.
Did part 4.
Did part 5.

Back to hw4.
Finished part 6.
Finished part 7. For the part 7 I created new functions vPos and vVel and didn't use the function vPosVel from part 4.6 for the convenience.
Checking the code.
Imported homework "hw4_oleksiy" as a module by doing.
import hw4_oleksiy as hw4.
Testing function drop() from problem 2.
hw4.drop() returned:
0.5532833351724881
Seems reasonable. Moving on.
Testing Problem 5.
hw4.hPos(3,-2,2) returned:
-1. That is correct exactly. Moving on.
Testing the function in problem 6.
What I got was the following tuple
(2.220446049250313e-16, -5.422176684690384)
The position is pretty much zero. The velocity at impact seems reasonable. Moving on.
Cheking Problem 7.
Doing hw4.vecPosVel(hw4.pos, hw4.vel, 2.3) returned
((-9.971, 18.759999999999998, 7.6), (-16.04, 7.2, 2))
Doing 
>>> pos2 = (1.5, 0, 0)
>>> vel2 = (0, 0, 0)
>>> hw4.vecPosVel(pos2, vel2, hw4.drop()) returned
((2.220446049250313e-16, 0.0, 0.0), (-5.422176684690384, 0, 0))
Cheking with if to see if the position is close to (0, 0, 0) and velocity is close to (-something, 0, 0)
>>> if ( hw4.vecPosVel(pos2, vel2, hw4.drop()) < ((1e-10,0,0),(0,0,0)) ):
...     print("YES!")
... else:
...     print("NO!")
... 
YES!
Everything works!.

    Started and made some progress on problem 2

The measure module is fully functional (at least I think so) and passes all given tests. The exoplanets module has some debugging issues that I don't have the time to figure out. However, the major piece of exoplanet module is correct code.
